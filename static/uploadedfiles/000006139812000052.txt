Bad Trace Definitions      Any of the following conditions shall qualify as a bad trace:      • Any hydrophone within a group is reversed polarity    • Sensitivity down by more than 3 dB from manufacturer’s specifications;   • Trace is dead;   • Trace is spiking or wild; or   • Signal distorted or out of phase by more than 30º or 1 millisecond.      Streamer Noise Definitions      Streamer noise shall be given in microbars RMS (Root Mean Square) and measured over the full recording   cycle with recording filters and with the streamer at the specified tow depth.       The following guidelines shall be used for determination of acceptable levels of coherent noise and swell   noise, but shall depend on geophysical objectives.  Whenever possible the use of onboard processing/QC   systems shall be used to further evaluate the effects of noise on the data.  In any case the final decision   shall rest with Company in consultation with its Designated Representative.      Ambient noise levels shall not exceed 250/(L) µbar for the first 10 traces, 100/(L) µbar for traces near   the depth controllers and modules; and 62.5/(L) µbar, for all other traces, where L = group length in   metres, and noise levels are measured through an 8 Hz low cut filter.      Swell noise of up to 25 µbar can be tolerated if appearing on less than 5% of shot records on any line and   is less than 2 seconds in duration.  Higher noise levels may be acceptable subject to Company Quality   Control Supervisor’s approval.      Coherent noise shall be assessed according to the following:      • amplitude of the interfering signal;   • duration of the noise;   • repetition and synchronisation of the interference; and   • moveout of the interference.
