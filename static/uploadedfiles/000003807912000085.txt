If and to the extent that the preceding provisions of this paragraph are inconsistent or conflict with the terms of any stock option agreement or non-qualified deferred compensation plan, then the preceding provisions of this paragraph shall govern and control.(d)    Cause any and all outstanding options to purchase common stock of the Company held by Executive to remain exercisable for twelve months after the last day of Executive’s employment with the Company (but in no event shall any such option be exercisable for (i) a longer period than the original term of such option (but in no event after the 10th anniversary of the original date of grant of such option) or (ii) a shorter period than that already provided for under the terms of such option).  If and to the extent that the preceding provisions of this paragraph are inconsistent or conflict with the terms of any stock option agreement, then the preceding provisions of this paragraph shall govern and control.4.    Interest on Late Payments.  If any payment provided for in Paragraphs 3(a) or 5 hereof is not made when due (determined after giving effect to any delay in such payment required pursuant to Paragraph 6(i)(2) hereof), the Company shall pay to Executive interest on the amount payable from the date that such payment should have been made under such paragraph until such payment is made, which interest shall be calculated at 10% plus the prime rate of interest announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank (or any successor thereto) at its principal office in New York on a non-compounded basis, and shall change when and as any such change in such prime rate shall be announced by such bank.5.    Certain Additional Payments by the Company.

The effective date of this Agreement is _________, 20__.  Within thirty (30) days after December 17, 2012 and within thirty (30) days after each successive thirty (30)-month period of time thereafter that this Agreement is in effect, the Company shall have the right to review this Agreement, and in its sole discretion either continue and extend this Agreement, terminate this Agreement, and/or offer Executive a different agreement.   The Compensation Committee (excluding any member of the Compensation Committee who is covered by this Agreement or by a similar agreement with the Company) will vote on whether to so extend, terminate, 7and/or offer Executive a different agreement and will notify Executive of such action within said thirty-day time period mentioned above.  This Agreement shall remain in effect until so terminated and/or modified by the Company.  Failure of the Compensation Committee to take any action within said thirty days shall be considered as an extension of this Agreement for an additional thirty-month period of time.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this “sunset provision”, it is agreed that if a Change of Control occurs while this Agreement is in effect, then this Agreement shall not be subject to termination or modification under this “sunset provision”, and shall remain in force for a period of thirty months after such Change of Control, and if within said thirty months the contingency factors occur which would entitle Executive to the benefits as provided herein, this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms.  If, within such thirty months after a Change of Control, the contingency factors that would entitle Executive to said benefits do not occur, thereupon this thirty-month “sunset provision” shall again be applicable with the thirty-day time period for Compensation Committee action to thereafter commence at the expiration of said thirty months after such Change of Control and on each thirty-month anniversary date thereafter.(b)    Indemnification.  If Executive shall obtain any money judgment or otherwise prevail with respect to any litigation brought by Executive or the Company to enforce or interpret any provision contained herein, the Company, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, hereby indemnifies Executive for his reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements incurred in such litigation and hereby agrees (i) to pay in full all such fees and disbursements and (ii) to pay prejudgment interest on any money judgment obtained by Executive from the earliest date that payment to him should have been made under this Agreement until such judgment shall have been paid in full, which interest shall be calculated at 10% plus the prime rate of interest announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank (or any successor thereto) at its principal office in New York on a non-compounded basis, and shall change when and as any such change in such prime rate shall be announced by such bank.  Any reimbursement of reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements required under this Paragraph 6(b) shall be made not later than the close of Executive’s taxable year following the taxable year in which Executive incurs the expense; provided, however, that, upon Executive’s termination of employment with the Company, in no event shall any additional reimbursement be made prior to the date that is six months after the date of Executive’s termination of employment to the extent such payment delay is required under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code.  In no event shall any reimbursement be made to Executive for such fees and disbursements incurred after the later of (A) Executive’s death or (B) the date that is 10 years after the date of Executive’s termination of employment with the Company.(c)    Payment Obligations Absolute.  The Company’s obligation to pay (or cause one of its subsidiaries to pay) Executive the amounts and to make the arrangements provided herein shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstances, including, without limitation, any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which the Company (including its subsidiaries) may have against him or anyone else.  All amounts payable by the Company (including its subsidiaries hereunder) shall be paid without notice or demand.  Executive shall not be obligated to seek other employment in mitigation of the amounts payable or arrangements made under any provision of this Agreement, and, except as provided in Paragraph 3(b) hereof, the obtaining of any such other employment shall in no event effect any reduction of the Company’s obligations to make (or cause to be made) the payments and arrangements required to be made 8under this Agreement.(d)    Successors.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and any successor of the Company, by merger or otherwise.  This Agreement shall also be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Executive and his estate.  If Executive shall die prior to full payment of amounts due pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts shall be payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to his estate.(e)    Severability.  Any provision in this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction by reason of applicable law shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating or affecting the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.(f)    Non-Alienation.  Executive shall not have any right to pledge, hypothecate, anticipate or assign this Agreement or the rights hereunder, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution.(g)    Notices.  Any notices or other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be sufficient if in writing.  In the case of Executive, such notices or communications shall be effectively delivered if hand-delivered to Executive at his principal place of employment or if sent by registered or certified mail to Executive at the last address he has filed with the Company.  In the case of the Company, such notices or communications shall be effectively delivered if sent by registered or certified mail to the Company at its principal executive offices.(h)    Controlling Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Colorado.(i)    Release and Delayed Payment Restriction.  (1)    As a condition to the receipt of any benefit under Paragraph 3 hereof, Executive shall first execute a release, in the form established by the Company, releasing the Company, its shareholders, partners, officers, directors, employees and agents from any and all claims and from any and all causes of action of any kind or character, including but not limited to all claims or causes of action arising out of Executive’s employment with the Company or the termination of such employment.(2)    The release described in Paragraph 6(i)(1) hereof must be effective and irrevocable within 55 days after the date of the termination of Executive’s employment with the Company.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if the payment of any amount or benefit under this Agreement would be subject to additional taxes and interest under Section 409A of the Code because the timing of such payment is not delayed as provided in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, then any such payment or benefit that Executive would otherwise be entitled to during the first six months following the date of Executive’s termination of employment shall be accumulated and paid or provided, as applicable, on the date that is six months after the date of Executive’s termination of employment (or if such date does not 9fall on a business day of the Company, the next following business day of the Company), or such earlier date upon which such amount can be paid or provided under Section 409A of the Code without being subject to such additional taxes and interest.  If this Paragraph 6(i)(2) becomes applicable such that the payment of any amount is delayed, any payments that are so delayed shall accrue interest on a non-compounded basis, from the date such payment would have been made had this Paragraph 6(i)(2) not applied to the actual date of payment, at the prime rate of interest announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank (or any successor thereto) at its principal office in New York on the date of Executive’s termination of employment (or the first business day following such date if such termination does not occur on a business day) and shall be paid in a lump sum on the actual date of payment of the delayed payment amount.  Executive hereby agrees to be bound by the Company’s determination of its “specified employees” (as such term is defined in Section 409A of the Code) in accordance with any of the methods permitted under the regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code.  Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Paragraph 6(i)(2), if Executive is entitled to a payment that would otherwise accrue interest at the Interest Credit Rate pursuant to Paragraph 3(a) but for the application of the preceding provisions of this Paragraph 6(i)(2), then (i) any interest that is to accrue with respect to such payment (whether pursuant to Paragraph 3(a) or this Paragraph 6(i)(2), but subject to Paragraph 4) shall be based on the Interest Credit Rate and (ii) for any period during which interest is provided with respect to such payment under both Paragraph 3(a) and this Paragraph 6(i)(2), interest shall accrue during such period under only one of such paragraphs.(j)    Full Settlement.  If Executive is entitled to and receives the benefits provided hereunder, performance of the obligations of the Company hereunder will constitute full settlement of all claims that Executive might otherwise assert against the Company on account of his termination of employment.(k)    Unfunded Obligation.  The obligation to pay amounts under this Agreement is an unfunded obligation of the Company (including its subsidiaries), and no such obligation shall create a trust or be deemed to be secured by any pledge or encumbrance on any property of the Company (including its subsidiaries).(l)    Not a Contract of Employment.  This Agreement shall not be deemed to constitute a contract of employment, nor shall any provision hereof affect (a) the right of the Company (or its subsidiaries) to discharge Executive at will or (b) the terms and conditions of any other agreement between the Company and Executive except as provided herein.(m)    Number and Gender.  Wherever appropriate herein, words used in the singular shall include the plural and the plural shall include the singular.  The masculine gender where appearing herein shall be deemed to include the feminine gender.  (n)    Entire Agreement.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof, and contains all the covenants, promises, representations, warranties and agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. Without limiting the scope of the preceding sentence, all understandings and agreements preceding the date of execution of this Agreement and relating to the subject matter hereof are hereby null and void and of no further force and effect, including, without limitation, all prior Severance 10Agreements, if any, by and between the Company and Executive. Any modification of this Agreement will be effective only if it is in writing and signed by the party to be charged.[Signatures begin on the following page.]11IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement effective as of the effective date in Paragraph 6(a).“EXECUTIVE”__________________________________[Insert Name]“COMPANY”FOREST OIL CORPORATIONBy: _______________________________12
